# Simple TODO App with ReactJS + TailwindCSS

## What did I learn with this Project?
Through building this Todo list app, I learned how to use ReactJS and specifically the useState hook to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. By implementing the functionality to add and delete tasks, I gained a deeper understanding of state management in React and how it can be leveraged to create interactive web applications. Overall, this project helped me to hone my skills in front-end development and provided valuable experience for future projects.

## Feature updates for this Project?
- I plan on adding a Edit feature for each of the Todo's that allows you to edit the Title of the Task!
- I plan on adding a Read more if the Text is too long
